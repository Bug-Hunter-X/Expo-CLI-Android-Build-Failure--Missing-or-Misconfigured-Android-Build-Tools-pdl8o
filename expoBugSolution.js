This solution explores various approaches to fix the Android build issue with Expo CLI.

**Approach 1: Reinstallation and Environment Variables**

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
// This part focuses on reinstalling the Android SDK and setting environment variables.
// Steps involve uninstalling the Android SDK, reinstalling it, and setting ANDROID_HOME and PATH variables.  The exact commands would depend on the operating system.
// ... (Include detailed instructions or scripts for reinstallation and environment variable setup based on OS)... 
```

**Approach 2: Gradle and SDK Version Compatibility Check**

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
// Check compatibility between the Gradle version specified in the project's `android/build.gradle` file and the installed Android SDK version.
// Update Gradle or Android SDK to ensure compatibility.
// ... (Include steps on how to check and update Gradle and SDK versions)...
```

**Approach 3: Project Cleaning and Rebuilding**

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
// Clean the project's build files to eliminate potential conflicts.  Then, rebuild the project.
//  This might involve running commands like: 
//  expo prebuild --clean
//  expo build:android --clean
// ... (Provide more detailed instructions with appropriate commands and context)...
```

**Approach 4 (If other approaches fail): Check for conflicting SDK installations**

Multiple Android SDK installations can sometimes cause conflicts. Try removing any unused installations and ensure only one installation path is set in the environment variables.
