This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with an error message indicating that the Android build tools are not found or are improperly configured.  This can happen even if the Android SDK is properly installed and configured.  The error may manifest in various ways, sometimes related to Gradle, other times more directly to the build tools themselves.
